# DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this task is to design and develop a basic yet professional personal portfolio website using only HTML and CSS. This type of website is used by web developers, designers, and other professionals to showcase their skills, projects, and contact information. The final deliverable should be a single-page responsive portfolio that includes navigation and adapts to different screen sizes.

**How to Complete This Task**

**1. Understand the Objective**

The main goal is to create a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate portfolio site that introduces you as a developer and displays a selection of your projects. The page should be clean, organized, and fully functional across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

**2. Plan the Layout**

Begin by planning the structure of your webpage. Your portfolio should typically include the following sections:

Home: A brief welcome message or tagline.

About: A short biography that highlights your background, skills, and interests.

Projects: A section where you list or describe a few key projects you’ve worked on.

Contact: Information such as your email, or links to your LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.

Each section should have a clear header and concise, well-written content.

**3. Design the Navigation**

Create a simple navigation bar that allows users to quickly scroll to different sections of the page. The navigation should remain easy to use on both large and small screens. Use anchor links that correspond to each section’s identifier.

**4. Build the Webpage Using HTML**

Start by writing the HTML structure. Use semantic elements such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> to give your site a logical, accessible structure. Add headings, paragraphs, and links where needed for clarity and content organization.

**5. Style the Webpage Using CSS**

Use CSS to bring your design to life. Apply a color scheme, fonts, and layout that reflect your personal brand. Use Flexbox or Grid for layout management, and include styling for mobile responsiveness through media queries. Keep the design consistent and modern, focusing on usability and readability.

**6. Ensure Responsiveness**

Make sure your site looks good on all devices. Use CSS media queries to adjust layout, text size, and element positioning for tablets and smartphones. Test the site by resizing your browser and viewing it on different devices if possible.

**7. Review and Finalize**

Go through your entire page and check for consistency, broken links, and grammar. Ensure all sections are properly aligned, and your content is clear. Make your site feel complete and professional.

**Conclusion**
Creating a personal portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS is a vital first step for anyone entering the field of web development or design. It helps you understand the fundamentals of web structure and styling while also giving you a platform to present your work. A well-designed portfolio not only highlights your skills but also demonstrates your attention to detail and ability to create user-friendly websites. Completing this task strengthens your foundational knowledge and adds a valuable asset to your professional toolkit.
